# Taxi Driver Problem

## Deliveries
- [x] Implementation of the solution in Python.
- [x] Test files using pytest.
- [x] Readme with implementation explanation.

## Files
- Input file:
   - 'T' to represent the initial position of the taxi.
   - 'P' to represent the passenger's initial position.
   - 'G' to represent the passenger's final position (goal).
   - 'B' to represent the barrier.
   - '.' to represent free spaces.
   - Example:
    
     TB.P
    
     .B..
    
     ...G
- Exit prompt:
   - Series of actions that the taxi will have to take to reach the final destination with the passenger.

## How to use
To run the main code you will have to put '''python ./main.py .\tests\map1.txt''' in the terminal, for example. The function argument will be the input file you want to test. With this, it will immediately make a printout on the terminal with the generated response.
